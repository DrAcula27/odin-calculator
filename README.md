<strong>The Odin Project - Foundations - JavaScript Basics - PROJECT: Calculator</strong>

<p>The goal of this project is to continue to build on and cement my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation skills and knowledge that I have gained while working through The Odin Project. This is the final project in The Odin Project's Foundations course.</p>
<p>This project is a browser version of a 4-function calculator, plus a few extras:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Toggle whether the number is positive or negative</li>
    <li>Convert the number to a percentage</li>
    <li>Decimal input, without adding more than one decimal</li>
    <li>An undo button, in case the user mis-clicks (or mis-types)</li>
    <li>Keyboard support</li>
</ul>
<em><p>NOTE: the calculator only evaluates one pair of numbers at a time, as per the specifications on the project page.</p></em>

<strong>After completing this project, I will have accomplished:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Continued improvement of version control using Git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Understanding the DOM and how to manipulate it</li>
    <li>Continued improvement of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Importing custom fonts using HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Using CSS pseudo elements to set a background image</li>
        <li>Practice with CSS flexbox and CSS grid</li>
        <li>Using JS to make HTML buttons function</li>
        <li>Practice breaking problems down into smaller, easy-to-solve problems</li>
        <li>Using JS to write functions to solve these small problems, and calling functions within functions to solve the larger problems</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
